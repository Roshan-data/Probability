| **Types of Experiment in Probability**          | Differentiates between random, deterministic, and compound experiments.   |
| **Conditional Probability**                     | Focuses on probability when one event has already occurred.               |
| **Bayes' Theorem**                              | Explains conditional probability and how Bayes' formula works.            |
| **Introduction to Probability Distributions**   | Overview of different types of probability distributions.                 |
| **Uniform Distribution**                        | Introduces the idea of equally likely outcomes in distributions.          |
| **Binomial Distribution**                       | Introduces binomial probability and its formula $P(X = k)$.               |
| **Normal Distribution**                         | Explains the bell curve, standard deviation, and Z-scores.                |
| **Central Limit Theorem**                       | Discusses how sample means tend to follow a normal distribution.          |
| **Probability Practice Question 1**             | Solved basic-level practice problems.                                     |
